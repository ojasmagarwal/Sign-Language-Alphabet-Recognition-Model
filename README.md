# Sign-Language-Alphabet-Recognition-Model

A CNN-based deep learning model is developed to recognize the alphabets and numbers of the Indian Sign Language (ISL). The model overcomes the class imbalance challenges through data augmentation to ensure optimal performance of the model.

The code utilizes python libraries,tensorflow and keras to pre-process the dataset and train the model

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have following dependencies -

+ Dataset 

* Python 2.7

- pip

Now, using pip install command, include following dependencies

+ Numpy

- Pandas

* Sklearn

+ Scipy

* Tensorflow

### To run the project, perform following steps -

1. Take the dataset folder and all the required python files and put them in the same folder.
2. Run the SignLanguage.py file to execute the code and predict the Alphabet or number given as input.

The model predicts the sign language alphabets and numbers with 97% accuracy
