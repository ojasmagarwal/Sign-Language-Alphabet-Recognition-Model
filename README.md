# Sign-Language-Alphabet-Recognition-Model
-> Developed a CNN‑based deep learning model with 97% accuracy to recognize sign language alphabets
-> Overcame class imbalance challenges through data augmentation to ensure optimal performance of the model.
-> Utilized Python, TensorFlow, and Keras to pre‑process dataset and train the model.
-> Aimed to facilitate communication for the deaf and hard‑of‑hearing community and break language barriers.
